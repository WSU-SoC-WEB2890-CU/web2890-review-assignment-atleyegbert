TODO: List here all the changes you made to given template to adapt it to your needs

1. The button in the banner section of my website now says "See What I've Been Up To" 
    and links to the portfolio section of my website. I felt this change was benefitial 
    for those using my site because it will directly connect them to the section of my site
    that shows my latest work. This would likely be the primary reason for visiting my site
    I felt that it was important to include a link to it near the top of the page.

2. I changed each of navigation tabs to match the changes I made to each of the sections on 
    the page. I added an "About", "Resume", and "Contact" tabs. Each of the tabs in the 
    navigation bar link to a different section of the page that relates to the tab. The 
    "About" tab links to the small about section of the page, the "Resume" tab links to the
    Education and Experience sections of the page, the "Testimonials" tab links to the 
    "Testimonials" section, ect. I felt that this change would be benefitial to my site 
    because users would be able to easily click to the section of the page that they want to
    get to instead of having to scroll.
    
3. I removed the section for companies that support or endorsed the site and replaced it with a 
    section about my education. I felt that the section for these companies logos did not make 
    sense for a portfolio website for me so that is why I removed it and replaced it with
    something that I felt was more appropriate.

4. For the "Education" and "Experience" sections of this page, I chose to use a Bootstrap list group 
    to organize the information in a clear way and so that it would also resemble a resume. I also included
    a link in the education section of the site that links to Weber State's website for the Web and User 
    Experience Major and a link in the Experience section that would allow users to view my full resume.
    I felt that a design resembling a resume would be benefitial to add to my site because it would be 
    easily recognized by most of my users and that it made the information easier for users to look at and read.
    I felt that including a link to learn more about those sections would also help users who are looking for more
    information about my program and for more information about my previous experience.

5. I changed the "Frequently Asked Questions" accordian section to be a breif introduction to a 
    couple of my most recent and significant projects. I did not feel that an FAQ section was 
    really necessary for this type of a website so again I changed it to be something more 
    appropriate. I thought users would want a breif introduction to some of these projects so that 
    they can learn a little more information about them than what is provided in the "Portfolio" 
    section.

6. I added a link at the bottom of each of the accordian dropdown content sections for my recent 
    projects. Each of the links let users know that they will be taken to a seperate page to learn 
    more about that project. Although they do not currently link to those projects, that is what I would
    do in the future for a real portfolio. I felt that this would be a benefitial addition to my webpage
    because users for my site would likely want to learn more about individual projects. 

7. I changed the "Services" section from the original site to be a "My Recipe for Great Design" section. 
    Although a services section could be a great addition to a portfolio website, I did not feel like it 
    was something that would add value to my site specifically. By changing it to a section for "My Recipe
    for Great Design" I could show users very quickly what qualities I could bring to a team and what my 
    values as a desinger are. Since my site also focuses on web accessibility, I felt that this was also 
    a great oppurtunity to expand on that. I mostly kept the layout the same, but I eliminated some elements
    that I felt did not relate or add to this section.

8. I made changes to the footer to better fit my needs for this website. I eliminated the section in the footer for 
    links to products because I do not have any products to advertise at this time. For the "Useful Links" section I added 
    links to Weber State University's Website and to their page for the Web and User Experience program that I am apart of. 
    I also changed the links in the "Contact" section to reflect my information. I felt that these changes were
    more appropriate for my site and informative for my users. 

9. I changed the filter buttons above my portfolio section to better represent the content in my portfolio. 
    I changed them to be for "Websites", "Design", "Animation" and "Photoshop". I felt that this change would make it 
    easier for users to locate the type of projects that they would like to learn more about and that would 
    fit thier needs for the type of skill they are looking for.
